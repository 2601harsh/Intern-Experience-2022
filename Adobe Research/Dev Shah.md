## Coding Round Experience
- It was a 2 hour test which consisted of 2 coding questions, 4 aptitude mcq questions, 4 probability mcq questions, 4 CS fundamental mcq questions and 4 linear algebra mcq questions. Time was sufficient. This test was the same across all three roles.

## Technical Round 1 Experience
- Duration : 15 min
- Number of interviewers : 1
- It was a very short interview but the interviewer asked questions from varying topics. It was more like a rapid fire:). He started with linear algebra, then asked some probability theory, then some OOPS basic questions. He then asked questions from the projects and then he asked me some random stuff related to my PoR and extracurricular achievements.


## Company specific Tips/Some resources
- Be frank to the interviewer. Just say I don’t know or I don’t remember if you don’t recall some stuff. Interview was mainly about what you know, rather than what you don’t know! Be quick and concise in your answers.
