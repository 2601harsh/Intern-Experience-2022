## Coding Round Experience
- It consisted of 3 questions to be solved in 90 minutes. 1 was easy, 1 medium, 1 hard. I guess, students who solved 3 or 2.5 or 2(maybe but not sure) were shortlisted for the interviews. 5 people were shortlisted for the interviews and 5 were on the waiting list. However, the interviews of students in the waiting list were not conducted.

## Technical Round 1 Experience
- Duration : 45 min - 60 min
- Number of interviewers : 1
- It was purely DSA based. 2 questions were asked and depending upon your interviewer, you will be either asked to write pseudocode or proper code! The interview was straight to the point. Nothing related to OOPS, DBMS, COA, Projects, C++ fundamentals was asked. Just 2 coding questions. The faster you solve it, the sooner the interview gets over!
- Question 1: Given a binary tree, check if it is possible to remove exactly 1 edge so that the tree is divided into 2 equal halves. (Equal in terms of number of nodes)

Answer: Count sort!


## Technical Round 2 Experience
