## Coding Round Experience
- Will update afterwards

## Technical Round 1 Experience
- Duration : 45 min
- Number of interviewers : 1
- We both introduced each other first of all. First 30 minutes of interview was completely dependent on OOPS and DBMS theory. Questions were asked from these topics in mode depth, so I just said don't know and moved on in 2/3 questions. Only 1 coding question was asked and was supposed to do it in 15 minutes.
- Question : Given a string of '(' and ')'. Find the largest size substring which is balanced paranthesis.

- First I mistakenly found the largest subsequence then the interviewer confirmed that he asked for substring, then i quickly changed my code as it was very easy question.

## Technical Round 2 Experience
- Duration : 1.5 hrs
- Number of interviewers : 3
- They all introduced themself and then I introduced myself. They aked me how was your day.
- First 45 minutes were things other than coding questions basically discussion on projects in depth and discusion on database as well as OOPS.
- Task 1 : They pasted Hello World! program and asked me to explain ech line in detail. They expected knowing about header files , Preprocessor directives, User defined namespace , why main function runs first etc.

- Task 2 : Given a balanced binary search tree and an element then find the next successor of that element in the tree.

- Task 3 : Given a number n, remove exactly x digits from n such that the remaining number formed by removing these digits is minimum. Find this minimum number.

- Task 4 : Water jug Puzzle - Given two Jugs of capacity of 3 and 5 respectively. Find if You can measure the capacity of 4 litres using these 2 jugs only.

- Task 5 : Was asked to wrote code if the capacities of 2 jugs and the value to measure are all given as variables. Here is the link to the same question.
- link : https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/water-jug-problem/ . 
- Already the interview was more longer than they said so they asked me to just write recursion when I said this is a memoization problem.
- They gave me chance to ask question. So when I asked them question related to Intuit, they asked me laughingly to just visit *Intuit Benefits webpage* before answering my question. That gave me a hint of getting selected ðŸ˜€

## Hr Experience
- There was no hr interview.

## Company specific Tips/Some resources
- Be honest 
- Answering questions rapidly may help, if you don't know then just say that you dont know rather than trying it wrong.
- They look at your attitude.
